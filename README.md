## Environment

To train tensorflow-gpu model locally, make sure your local environment is:

Python <= 3.10.x
Numpy = 1.23.5
Tensorflow = 2.10.0.0

If you do not want to train the model from the beginning, just load the best_model.h5

## Webpage

The webpage is a demo of the facial recognition deployment using Streamlit. However, it has not been deployed online since the TensorFlow conflict. To run locally, open a command prompt, move to the directory that you clone this repo, run this line:

streamlit run app.py
